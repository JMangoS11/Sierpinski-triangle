# Sierpinski-triangle
Project that looks into the theory of the Sierpinski triangle. Made this a while ago. 

What it is: (Given three points) Draw a new point anywhere, lets call it P1. Choose a random starting point (One of the three) and make another point (P2), placing it half the distance from P1 to the chosen starting point. Then repeat with P2. The theory is that the shape the points eventually will make forever is the Sierpinski triangle AKA a triangle fractle.
